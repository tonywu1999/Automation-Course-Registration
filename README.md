# SIS Automated Registration

Run: python3 main.py

This is a script that you can run to automate registering for classes at a designated time.

NOTE: You must download the selenium package before
running this script because that package allows you to automate
opening up google chrome.  

Install Selenium: `pip3 install selenium`

Ultimately, the script will ask for your username and password. You can designate
with the datetime package when the webdriver should open and perform
certain actions.
