This is a script that you can run to automate registering for classes at a designated time.
Ultimately, the script will ask for your username and password. Then at a specific time, it will
open up Google Chrome for you and log onto SIS.  You can designate
with the datetime package when the webdriver should open and perform
certain actions.
